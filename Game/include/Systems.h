// Actually creating a system table and initialising the systems can have many
// configurations, so we leave this to client code external to this static lib
// However some of the systems do need to refer to each other - the primary
// example being for logging. Hence, the client code should set this pointer
// as soon as it has created a SystemsTable instance and before initialising
// the subsystems.

// If you want to pass around a SystemsTable without having this variable
// directly accessible, prefer to include just SystemsTable.h
